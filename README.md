Making a repository

Hello humans, I am practicing github, so I can get better at it. I am taking WevDev 1 and intro to programming. In WebDev we are using html and re recently were introduced to Atom.io. Atom.io is much better than notepad++. I am excited to see what editor we will be using next. I intro to programming we recently started using python. I want to upload projects here and I am excited to start using this site. Also, the example in the tutorial made me hungry for tacos.
